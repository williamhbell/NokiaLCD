# Nokia 5110/3310 monochrome LCD driver

The code in this repository started life on the Raspberry Pi forum.  It was then modified slightly
and two example programs were added.  The example programs show an image and the current
IP address(es) of the Raspberry Pi.  Installation and usage instructions are given in the
file INSTALL.txt.
